 Notes

 Python is a zero based language! [0] = the first item.

 Variable  notes


 \n = new line
 \" = puts " in without breaking string
 len(variable_name) = variable_name.length()
 .replace("old str", "new str") = replaces strings

 Number notes

 abs(num) = absolute value
 pow(num, exponent) = exponents
 from ___ import * = imports everything from a library, such as math

 List notes

 num = [2, 3, 4] num[-1] = 4. num[-2] = 3. Negative index starts from the last item going backward.
 [1:] = all list items starting from the second one. [1:4] All items from the second to, but not including, the fifth.
 .extend() adds a list to the end of your current list. Ex. num.extend(people) = [2, 3, 4, "Derek", "Sam", "Jake"]
 .append() adds one value to the end of your current list. Ex num.append(5) = [2, 3, 4, 5]
 .insert() takes 2 values.The index you want your new value to be in, and the new value. Ex num.insert(2,9) = [2,3,9,4]
 .remove() removes a value that you put in. Not index of the value, the value itself!
 .clear() clears a list.
 .pop() pops the last value out of a list.
 .index() finds the index of a value. Value isn't in list? Error!
 .count() counts how much values are inside the list.
 .sort() sorts values in an array by alphabetical order if they're words, and ascending order if numbers. Both = error
 .copy() creates a list copy
 Tuples are like lists, but cannot change!

 Function notes

 Function code is indented. Stop indenting and you're not in that function anymore.
 Parameters are same as JS
 Return is same as JS

 If statements

 Ifs are very similar in Python to JS. Instead of {}, it's : Indented code is also in use for ifs. else is not indented
 Elif (py) is the same as else if (js)

Inheritance

Biggest(Bigger) = Makes Biggest inherit all the the properties of Bigger, so that you don't have to copy and paste.
You do have to import, of course.
